## Task-1 Call Center Data Analysis

I have started a virtual internship from PwC Switzerland provided on the Forge platform where my role was a Power BI Analyst.
This is the 1st task given in the Internship. - Call Center Trend Analysis

### 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:
► In this project, I have to Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire (Call Center Manger) that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

KPI Include:
► Overall customer satisfaction
► Overall calls answered/abandoned
►Calls by time
►Average speed of answer
►Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

As per the above requirement I tried to create a dashboard by using Power BI, the approach I followed is mentioned below.
### Insights

--> Total 5000 nos. of call recived during 03 months of period, out of that 4054 call are answered & 946 calls are rejected on daily basis 160+ calls are recorded.<br>
